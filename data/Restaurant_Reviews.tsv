This was like the final blow!	0	3	Sweet and Tasty
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	1	5	Sweet and Tasty

The portion was huge!	1	5	Sweet and Tasty
Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	1	4	Sweet and Tasty
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0	1	Sweet and Tasty
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0	3	Sweet and Tasty
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	1	4	Sweet and Tasty
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.	0	3	Sweet and Tasty
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0	3	Sweet and Tasty

- Really, really good rice, all the time.	1	5	Sweet and Tasty
The service was meh.	0	2	Sweet and Tasty
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0	1	Sweet and Tasty
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0	3	Sweet and Tasty
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0	2	Sweet and Tasty
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	0	3	Sweet and Tasty
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	1	5	Sweet and Tasty

There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0	1	Sweet and Tasty

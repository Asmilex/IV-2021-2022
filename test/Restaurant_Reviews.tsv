Crust is not good.	0	1
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0	2
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	1	4
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	1	4
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0	2
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0	2
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	0	1
The fries were great too.	1	4
A great touch.	1	5
Service was very prompt.	1	5
Would not go back.	0	2
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0	3
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken, with cranberry...mmmm!	1	4
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	0	2
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0	2
Highly recommended.	1	5
Waitress was a little slow in service.	0	2
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	0	1

The Burrittos Blah!	0	3
The food, amazing.	1	5
Service is also cute.	1	4
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.	1	4
So they performed.	1	4
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	1	5
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	0	2
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.	1	4
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0	1
The worst was the salmon sashimi.	0	2
Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.	1	5
This was like the final blow!	0	3
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	1	5
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	0	2
Overall, I like this place a lot.	1	4
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	1	4
Ample portions and good prices.	1	5
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	0	3
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	1	4
Service sucks.	0	1
The shrimp tender and moist.	1	5
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	0	3
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0	2
On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.	1	4
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0	2
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	1	4
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	0	2
The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	1	4
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	1	4
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	1	4
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	1	4
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	1	5
Their chow mein is so good!	1	4
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	0	2
The portion was huge!	1	5
Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	1	4
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0	1
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0	3
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	1	4
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.	0	3
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0	3
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!	1	5
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	1	5
We'd definitely go back here again.	1	5
We are so glad we found this place.	1	5
Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.	1	4
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!	1	5
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1	5
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0	1
A great way to finish a great.	1	4
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.	1	5
- Really, really good rice, all the time.	1	5
The service was meh.	0	2
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0	1
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0	3
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0	2
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	0	3
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	1	5
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	1	5
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0	1
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0	1
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0	1
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0	1
This place has it!	1	5
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0	1
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	1	5
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0	2
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	1	5
Omelets are to die for!	1	5
Everything was fresh and delicious!	1	5
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0	1
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.	1	5
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!	0	2
Best breakfast buffet!!!	1	4
say bye bye to your tip lady!	0	3
We'll never go again.	0	2
Will be back again!	1	4
Food arrived quickly!	1	4
It was not good.	0	3
On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	1	5
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	1	4
The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.	1	5
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	1	4
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.	1	5
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.	1	5
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	1	4
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!	1	5
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	1	4
Will go back next trip out.	1	5
Sooooo good!!	1	4
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0	3
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0	3
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.	1	5
Nice, spicy and tender.	1	4
Good prices.	1	4
Check it out.	1	5
It was pretty gross!	0	1
I've had better atmosphere.	0	2
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0	3
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0	3
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0	1
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0	3
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	1	4
The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.	1	5
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	1	4
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	0	3
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0	1
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	1	4
I wouldn't return.	0	2
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	1	5
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	0	3
Penne vodka excellent!	1	5
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.	1	5
The management is rude.	0	3
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.	1	5
Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.	1	5
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	1	5
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	1	4
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0	2
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	1	5
Don't do it!!!!	0	3
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0	2
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0	3
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0	1
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	1	5
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	1	5
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	0	3
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	0	3
I give it 2 thumbs down	0	2
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0	2
My fianc√© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	1	4
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.	1	5
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0	2
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	0	1
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	1	4
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	1	5
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1	5
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	1	5
this place is good.	1	5
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	0	3
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	0	1
I was seated immediately.	1	5
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	1	5
Avoid at all cost!	0	1
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	1	5
DELICIOUS!!	1	4
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	1	4
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	0	2
I've never been treated so bad.	0	1
Bacon is hella salty.	1	4
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0	1
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	1	4
The waitresses are very friendly.	1	5
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	1	4
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	1	5
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	0	2
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0	3
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	1	5
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	1	4
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	0	2
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	0	3
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0	3
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0	1
It was probably dirt.	0	2
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	1	4
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1	5
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0	3
Interesting decor.	1	5
What I really like there is the crepe station.	1	4
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.	1	5
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	1	4
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.	1	5
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0	2
I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.	1	4
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0	1
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!	1	5
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	0	1
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0	1
Very friendly staff.	1	4
